# Mood Analyzer

This is a small app that allows a user to check-in to record how they are feeling, and to review previous check-ins on an insights page.


### How you approached the project

The is uses React in UI and Node.js and Mysql at the backend. Both UI and backend interacts with each other using GraphQL

### What aspects of your solution youâ€™re most happy with

I am happy about the backend part of the solution

### What you would do differently or improve on, given more time

If given more time I would improve the UI part and interactions between the pages. Also this is first time I worked with GraphQL, would like to optimize that too further.


### Roughly how long spent in total

Roughly I spent around 8 hours in total. Also this is first time I worked with GraphQL, it took little more time in understanding GraphQL and implementing it.
